# CHAPTER 1: WITHHOLDING PROCESSING INTRODUCTION

This guide is designed to provide an overview of the tasks involved with Withholding Processing. The guide shows users how to process Withholding Forms for a calendar year, as well as how to complete tasks throughout the year for smooth withholding processing.

1099 Withholding Reportable Items are those items payable to unincorporated entities (individuals, sole proprietors, or partnerships) for services, non-employee compensation, rents, royalties, or prizes and awards. Each institution is responsible for tracking its Withholding reportable items, sending reports to individual suppliers, and sending a file to the IRS noting reportable items and suppliers.

Due to the possibility of IRS changes each year, users should verify they are working from the most recent version of this manual. This user’s guide does not provide legal tax advice on what is and is not reportable. This guide only provides guidance on how to process withholding information.

## Withholding Income

Typically, employees of a business receive a W-2 form that lists income received throughout the year. This W-2 form also contains deductions taken from that income in the form of federal and state taxes, deferred compensation, Social Security contributions, etc.

Unlike W-2s, independent suppliers receive a 1099-MISC or 1099-NEC form, which is a record of income received from an organization. On this form, income earned is noted but there typically will not be any deductions for federal or state income taxes nor any deferred compensation, Social Security or medical deductions.

Withholding income is also reported to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) so that the IRS can track income received by taxpayers. A Withholding Supplier is obligated to make his/her own tax deductions and forward payments to the IRS, if required.

## 1099 Withholding Types and Classes

Withholding Types allow withholding transactions to be categorized by classes. Before CY2020 institutions produced one form for all Withholding miscellaneous income regardless of withholding type and class. However, beginning CY2020, USG Institutions produce two forms to report miscellaneous income to the IRS: 1099-MISC forms and 1099-NEC forms. Each Withholding Type is described below:

### Withholding Type 1099N

**Reported on form 1099-NEC (Non-Employee Compensation)**

The most common type of 1099 income is non-employee compensation (NEC). Beginning with calendar year 2020, institutions use Form 1099-NEC to report non-employee compensation.

For questions or more information on the 1099-NEC, refer to IRS publication here.

### Withholding Type 1099M

**Reported on form 1099-MISC (Miscellaneous Income)**

Institutions use the 1099-MISC form to report other reportable miscellaneous income.

For questions or more information about 1099-MISC, refer to IRS publication here.
